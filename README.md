# Introduction
Basic chess game to be played in the console (Java)

This is a chess game that is to be played on the terminal. It does not have AI, rather, you can play against yourself or against another person next to you! :)

The console outputs a visual representation of the board that will be updated after each move. To play enter the position notation of the piece you want to move and of where you want to move to. The program will ensure the move is legal before updating the board and switching whose turn it is. Enjoy!

# To Run
Run `java Main` on the command line to run the program. (Assumes Java is installed)

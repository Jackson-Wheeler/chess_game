Chess Game to be played in the console (Java)

This is a chess game that is to played on the console (terminal). It does not have AI, rather, you can play against yourself or against another person next to you. The console outputs a visual representation of the board that will be updated after each move. To play you will enter the position notation of the piece you want to move and then the position notation of the location you want to move to. If the move is legal it will go through.

To run the code make sure you have Java installed. Then, type "Java Main" into your terminal to run the program (at least that's how you do it on a mac).
